As we move away from the mean on both directions, the frequency of observations reduce creating two tails at both ends. The red line above shows a probability \"**Density**\" function, as compared to Probability functions we saw with cdf and pmf. A Probability Density Function (pdf) helps identify the regions in the distribution where observations are more likely to occur i.e. it is more dense. Remember that while dealing with pmfs, we calculated the **mass** for each class. For the case of continuous variable, we do not have fixed number of possible outcomes as described above. so instead we create a density function.  \n",

    "Probability functions are great for figuring out **intervals** because as shown above, it is hard to identify an exact point. A height of 6 feet (72 inches) is actually considered interval between say 5.99 feet and 6.01 feet which makes it an interval for dealing with this continuous variable. So we have to be careful when reading probability density functions, especially when it comes to exact numbers. For heights, What about the probability any person will weigh exactly 6 feet? Written in notation, the question would be:\n",

    "> **P( Height = 72 )**\n",

    "Looking at the graph, you might think that the probability of a person having height of exactly six feet it 0.05 or 5%, but this not accurate. The idea that 5% of people are **exactly** 6 ft tall is just not conceivable. Heights would differ in terms of millimeters, micrometers or even nanometers. The person could be 6.00012 or 5.99987 feet tall. In fact, the probability of someone being exactly 6ft is so tiny. it’s practically **zero**. So we need to define an interval to capture the value. If we set our interval as heights between say 71.9 and 72.1 inches, we can write this as:\n",

    "**Kernel density estimation** or KDE is a common  non-parametric estimation technique to plot a curve (the kernel) at every individual data point. These curves are then added to plot a smooth density estimation. The kernel most often used is a Gaussian (which produces a bell curve at each data point). Other kernels can be used in special cases when the underlying distribution is not normal. \n",

This has saved us from calculating histograms, normalizing them , finding probabilities etc. You can further customize these plots to your heart's content. Have a look at official seaborn documentation for their color pellets, styles, labelling options etc. \n",
